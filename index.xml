      <description>BoardGameGeek (BGG) users can select their country of residence in their profile. The main purpose is to find other users in your region to play face to face or maybe trade games, but but over here at Recommend.Games we obviously cannot help ourselves but to use this information for some interesting statistics. ðŸ¤“&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the usual disclaimer: We will have to rely on whatever information BGG provides. In particular, users can freely choose their country.</description>

      <title>Has board game rating inequality increased over the years?</title>

      <description>The number of ratings per game Perhaps one of the most controversial choices of the Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down Effect article was using the number of ratings1 on BoardGameGeek (BGG) as proxy for &amp;ldquo;attention&amp;rdquo; to a game. So let&amp;rsquo;s double down on that! ðŸ˜ˆ&#xA;If lots of ratings mean a lots of eyes on a game, we can ask questions like: What games get most of the attention? Do few games steal the spotlight?</description>

      <description>Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down (SU&amp;amp;SD) is arguably the largest (at over 400k subscribers) and most influential YouTube channel in board gaming. A video with a glowing recommendation by them can lead to a game sell out overnight. Or at least that&amp;rsquo;s how the anecdotes go. There&amp;rsquo;s been previous attempts at quantifying the effect, but over here at Recommend.Games is where board games and data science meet, so obviously, we have to dig a little deeper.</description>

      <title>How long is a game of High Society?</title>

      <guid>https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/high-society/</guid>
      <description>High Society is a classic bidding game by classic designer Dr Reiner Knizia, most recently released by Osprey Games with a wonderfully classic look:&#xA;The general concept is quite simple: the players are members of said &amp;ldquo;high society&amp;rdquo; and are trying to outdo each other in showing off their wealth. The game is played over a series of rounds, and in each round, a card is revealed from a deck of 16 cards.</description>

      <description>Orchard is a beloved children&amp;rsquo;s game classic which is so old â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s as old as myself. ðŸ‘´ As one might expect from a children&amp;rsquo;s game, it&amp;rsquo;s really simple: roll a die, pick a fruit of the corresponding color, and put it in the basket. If you roll the raven, the raven moves one step closer to the orchard. If you manage to pick all the fruit before the raven reaches the orchard, you win together.</description>

      <description>The hiatus is over! Already since April 2023 the recommendation engine at Recommend.Games has been back online, albeit with reduced functionality. In order to cut down serving costs, I made the recommendation model much more lightweight (this deserves its own article) and removed rarely used features as well as a bunch of bloat from the database.&#xA;Most of the database was filled with users&amp;rsquo; collection items, i.e., games they rated, owned, have played etc.</description>

      <description>The cat&amp;rsquo;s out of the bag and the winners have been announced!&#xA;This year&amp;rsquo;s show wasâ€¦ longâ€¦ On the one hand, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have all three awards (including the Kinderspiel) back together in one announcement, but on the other hand, once you add special awards, the review of the 1983 awards, interviews etc, even die hard fans (and obviously I&amp;rsquo;m one of them) have a hard time keeping their attention up.</description>

The predictions for the longlist come directly from the recommendendations out of all eligible1 games. Our very own Kennerspiel score is then used to sort those into their respective list of the top 10 contenders for either award.</description>

I registered the domain Recommend.Games on November 22nd, 2018. On May 15th, 2020, I published the first post on this blog. Over the years, this site attracted more than 50,000 users, which is a huge number, if you think about it.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s time! On Monday, July 19, we will finally know which games won Spiel des Jahres and Kennerspiel des Jahres 2021. I really think this is an exciting year with six very strong nominees that all have a lot of arguments going for themselves (and a few against). Even after following the whole year releases very closely, I&amp;rsquo;m still torn as to who&amp;rsquo;d be the favourites to win. Algorithms won&amp;rsquo;t be much help here either â€“ the sample is just too small.</description>

Just like last year, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to produce a list of the most promising games to land on the longlist for Spiel and Kennerspiel.

      <description>Spiel des Jahres 2021 nominations might still be a couple of months away, but I thought now is still a good time to return to one of the harder questions in my predictions post from last year: What exactly makes a game a Kennerspiel? By that I don&amp;rsquo;t mean the qualities that earn a game the award, but the distinction between the more casual Spiel and the more complex Kennerspiel categories.</description>

      <description>This is the second part of a series explaining and analysing the BoardGameGeek rankings. Read the first part here.&#xA;Last time I left you with the nice result that BoardGameGeek (BGG) calculates its ranking by taking users&amp;rsquo; ratings for a particular game and then add around 1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5. This so-called geek score is used to sort the games from best (Gloomhaven) to worst (Tic-Tac-Toe).&#xA;One detail however we touched on in passing, but did not resolve, is how that number of dummy ratings develop over time.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: BoardGameGeek calculates its ranking by adding around 1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5 to the regular users&amp;rsquo; ratings. They called it their geek score, statisticians call it a Bayesian average. We use this knowledge to calculate some alternative rankings.&#xA;I often describe BoardGameGeek (BGG) as &amp;ldquo;the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for games&amp;rdquo;. Much like its cinematic counterpart, the biggest board game database not only collects all sorts of information obsessively, but also allows users to rate games on a scale from 1 (awful - defies game description) to 10 (outstanding - will always enjoy playing).</description>

In addition to that, there are six games the jury recommends. Do these games match the criteria I stipulated last time?</description>
