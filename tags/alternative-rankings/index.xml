      <description>We have some pretty exciting news! ðŸ¤© Since 2022-02-22, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using a new and improved ranking as the default sorting for our front page at Recommend.Games.
â€¦ What do you mean, you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed there&amp;rsquo;s a R.G ranking? You know, that thing that&amp;rsquo;s referenced in the statistics? â€¦ You haven&amp;rsquo;t ever opened that view?!? ðŸ˜±
OK, let&amp;rsquo;s back up for a second. R.G&amp;rsquo;s primary purpose is a recommendation engine, that is, finding personalised game recommendations based on a user&amp;rsquo;s preferences (in this case as expressed through their BoardGameGeek ratings).</description>

      <description>TL;DR: BoardGameGeek calculates its ranking by adding around 1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5 to the regular users&#39; ratings. They called it their geek score, statisticians call it a Bayesian average. We use this knowledge to calculate some alternative rankings.
I often describe BoardGameGeek (BGG) as &amp;ldquo;the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for games&amp;rdquo;. Much like its cinematic counterpart, the biggest board game database not only collects all sorts of information obsessively, but also allows users to rate games on a scale from 1 (awful - defies game description) to 10 (outstanding - will always enjoy playing).</description>
