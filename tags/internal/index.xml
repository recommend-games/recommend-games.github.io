      <description>The hiatus is over! Already since April 2023 the recommendation engine at Recommend.Games has been back online, albeit with reduced functionality. In order to cut down serving costs, I made the recommendation model much more lightweight (this deserves its own article) and removed rarely used features as well as a bunch of bloat from the database.&#xA;Most of the database was filled with users&amp;rsquo; collection items, i.e., games they rated, owned, have played etc.</description>

      <description>Update: The hiatus is over! Recommend.Games is back, albeit with some reduced functionality.&#xA;The very first commit to the project ludoj1, as I called it back then, was on December 5th, 2016. I registered the domain Recommend.Games on November 22nd, 2018. On May 15th, 2020, I published the first post on this blog. Over the years, this site attracted more than 50,000 users, which is a huge number, if you think about it.</description>
