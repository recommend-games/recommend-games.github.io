      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Thompson (of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@aboveboardTV&#34;&gt;Above Board TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dicetowerdish.com/&#34;&gt;Dice Tower Dish&lt;/a&gt; fame) recently raised an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3336646/playtesting-327&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamesinsider.com/&#34;&gt;Board Games Insider podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In what year do you think the best titles (highest rated titles) were released?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He actually answered the question twice, first in episode &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/163710/board-games-insider-328-the-one-about-the-spiel-de&#34;&gt;#328&lt;/a&gt; based on an analysis he ran a couple of years ago and then again in &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/164172/board-games-insider-330-the-one-about-the-biggest&#34;&gt;#330&lt;/a&gt; with more up-to-date data. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to spoil his answer here ‚Äì the podcast in general is worth a listen ‚Äì so go and find those episodes on your favourite podcast platform. But of course I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but answer the question myself, in the most needlessly thorough way possible. ü§ì&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;boring-technicalities&#34;&gt;Boring technicalities&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to make sure we understand what the question is asking. I&amp;rsquo;d say there&amp;rsquo;s two general ways to interpret it: either average the ratings of the games released in a given year, or average all the ratings for all the games of that year. I think the difference between those approaches becomes much clearer with an example: Let&amp;rsquo;s pick the year 1995. There&amp;rsquo;s 224 ranked games from that year; all games (ranked and unranked) received a total of 276,158 ratings as of the time of writing. The former approach would be to average the individual ratings of those 224 games, whilst the latter would mean taking the average of those quarter of a million ratings. The reason why I picked 1995 as an example is of course because that year is dominated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;: This giant amongst hobby games alone accounts for almost half all the ratings from 1995. So when averaging games&amp;rsquo; ratings, &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt; would have as much weight as some forgotten title with 30 ratings (the minimum required to be ranked). On the other hand, if we take the average over all ratings, we&amp;rsquo;d have less an average rating of that year and more of an average for &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;. Neither approach would be right or wrong, they&amp;rsquo;re just different choices, so let&amp;rsquo;s try them both out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-from-rankings&#34;&gt;Data from rankings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-ratings&#34;&gt;Average ratings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the average of games actually presents two different options in its own right because BoardGameGeek (BGG) uses both plain averages for display purposes and Bayesian averages for &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the plain average:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_rankings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings from ranked games&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every dot is a year between 1970 (before then very few games have enough ratings) and 2023, with its height on the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicating the average rating of all games released in that year (higher is better) and the size of the dot indicating the number of games. The acceleration in the past few years is striking, so looking at this plot the answer to Corey&amp;rsquo;s question would definitely have to be: &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt; (and counting).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;geek-scores&#34;&gt;Geek scores&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we might want to refrain from using those plain averages in this context for the same reason they&amp;rsquo;re not used for ranking: the averages for games with few ratings are just too swingy. So let&amp;rsquo;s look at the Bayesian averages (aka geek scores) instead:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/bayes_ratings_from_rankings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average geek score from ranked games&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of interesting observations about this plot. First of, there&amp;rsquo;s a much more uniform linear trend going on, though there&amp;rsquo;s a notable drop in the last two years. That can easily be explained by the way the Bayesian averages are calculated: the dummies ratings that get added to the regular ones weigh much heavier on games with fewer ratings, which naturally is the case for newer games. So this plot tells us that &lt;strong&gt;2019&lt;/strong&gt; should be considered the best year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;linear-regression&#34;&gt;Linear regression&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it though? Or is it simply the most recent year with complete data? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the best year be the one that defeated the trend? To answer those questions, let&amp;rsquo;s first make the trend explicit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/bayes_ratings_from_rankings_reg.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average geek score from ranked games (including trend line)&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added the &lt;em&gt;line of best fit&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., the one that follows the trend most closely, via standard linear regression. The shaded band indicates the 95% confidence interval, i.e., we can be 95% confident that the true trend line lies within that band.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very simply put, the trends tells us that the average game from 1970 has a geek score of around 5.516. This makes sense, since it is strongly pulled towards the value 5.5 of the dummy ratings added to calculate this Bayesian average. According to the trend, that geek score then increases year on year by about 0.004. This might not sound like much, but 53 years later, in 2023, the average game should have a geek score of 5.722. In increase of over 0.2 is huge for a score that is so strongly drawn to its mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was now talking of the hypothetical scores if they were indeed lining up perfectly on that trend line. The reality is slightly more messy, and we can now calculate the difference between the actual average values for a year and the trend line. Years that beat the expecation from the trend lie above that line, underperforming years under the line. So now we can find the year that is the best in relation to the trend of its time, which is ‚Ä¶ ü•Å ‚Ä¶ &lt;strong&gt;1977&lt;/strong&gt;. This might not be the most obvious year at first glance, but when looking more closely, it did bring forth iconic titles such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/1035&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Squad Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/15&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/811&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Rummikub&lt;/a&gt;. In light of those games, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s a well earned title.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one can also look at the underperforming years. Generally, it appears that the 70s are still held in high regards, whilst from the mid 80s to the mid 00s most years are underperforming, with the worst year being &lt;strong&gt;1996&lt;/strong&gt;. This makes 1995 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/93&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;El Grande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/220&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;High Society&lt;/a&gt;, stand out even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-from-ratings&#34;&gt;Data from ratings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve promised a different way to calculate the average ratings for each year, so now we look at all the individual ratings for all the games released in that year and average those. Here&amp;rsquo;s the result plot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_ratings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see a similar increasing trend, but one that does continue to the present, so again, we&amp;rsquo;d have to say that the best year for games is &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;. Another interesting observation is that the slope is much steeper. Let&amp;rsquo;s make this concrete:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_ratings_reg.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings (including trend line)&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the trend tells us that the average rating for 1970 is 5.926, but here the yearly increase is almost 0.03, an order of magnitude higher than when we looked at the geek scores, so we end up with a trend of 7.471 for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what years are the biggest winners and losers compared to the trend? The biggest overperformer, by quite a margin, is &lt;strong&gt;1980&lt;/strong&gt; according to this measure. It got classics such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/71&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/41&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop&lt;/a&gt; going for itself, which hit really hard in this metric since there&amp;rsquo;s so few ratings for those old games, as you can tell by those vanishingly small dots. Other strong positive outliers are 1982 (with &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/2511&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/2653&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the aforementioned 1995 and 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most disappointing year in this category is &lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;/strong&gt;, which is curiously nested between the strong 2000 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/822&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;) and 2002 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/3076&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-for-significance&#34;&gt;Testing for significance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I promised excrutiating details, didn&amp;rsquo;t I? So I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta answer one more question: Are those outliers significant, or are they just randomly spread around the trend line? Statistical testing is a vast field ‚Äì so vast in fact that I always feel completely lost whenever I enter it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s not make things overly complicated. In their most basic form, most of those tests boil down to checking if values we&amp;rsquo;re looking at don&amp;rsquo;t stray too far from the mean. In our case, we look at the distances between actual values and the trend line and check how they are distributed. Those values that lie more than two standard deviations from the mean could be considered significant outliers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in any of those statistical details, you can just call your favourite software package to calculate the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value, which ‚Äì roughly speaking ‚Äì tells you the probability that the effect you observed is due to random chance. The smaller the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value, the more likely you&amp;rsquo;ve observed the actual effect you were interested in. Usually, an arbitrary threshold is chosen, often 5%. Observations with a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value below that threshold are considered significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have two years significantly outperforming the trend (1980 and 1982) and two significantly underperforming (1996 and 2001). So, I guess we can conclude by calling those years the confirmed best and worst years, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Except, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying when I said I&amp;rsquo;d be going into unnecessary depths. ü§ì) One possible interpretation of that 5% threshold is that you&amp;rsquo;ll get positive results just by random chance in 1 in 20 experiments. But when we just calculated &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values for 53 years, we effectively performed 53 experiments, so a couple of years sticking out randomly would actually be expected. Again, there&amp;rsquo;s a vast body of research to deal with those multiple tests. For good measure, I&amp;rsquo;ve checked the outcome for the procedures according to Bonferroni, Holm and Benjamini‚ÄìHochberg, but the result is the same for all of them: None of the years differ significantly from the trend. So I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve just wrote over 1500 words just to conclude that the best years in board gaming are yet to come. There&amp;rsquo;s some comfort in that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;golden-age-or-cult-of-the-new&#34;&gt;Golden age or cult of the new?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me finish with a more philosophical thought: We&amp;rsquo;ve collected a lot of evidence to confidently conclude that the average ratings have been increasing over the years and continue to do so, but what is the reason for this? Is it because we are, as many people claim, in a &amp;ldquo;golden age of board gaming&amp;rdquo;? Or is it a by-product of the &amp;ldquo;cult of the new&amp;rdquo; which willingly drops hundreds of dollars on games that don&amp;rsquo;t even exist yet, but which receive perfect ratings from their backers as if to reassure themselves that this was a sound investment?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s a definitive answer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation&#34;&gt;Grade inflation&lt;/a&gt; is a real thing, and if it affects professional teachers who (hopefully) put a lot of thought and attention into the way they rate students, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume the same will be true for some random people judging games on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s also true that designer games are still a very young art form and their creators have made a tremendous amount of progress in their craft over the past decades. In that respect, it&amp;rsquo;s understandable that gamers want to express their appreciation for those advances. Let&amp;rsquo;s just hope we won&amp;rsquo;t run out of rating space before this century is over: At the current pace, every game will be a perfect 10 by the year 2110.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the full results from the ranking data &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_rankings.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the test results &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_rankings_stats.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, results from the rating data &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_ratings.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and corresponding test results &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_ratings_stats.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As always, you can find the full analysis code and notebooks on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/blog/-/tree/master/experiments/highest_rated_year&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Has board game rating inequality increased over the years?</title>
      <link>https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/rating-inequality-gini-coefficient/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 14 Apr 2024 18:20:45 +0300</pubDate><author>contact@recommend.games (Recommend.Games)</author>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-number-of-ratings-per-game&#34;&gt;The number of ratings per game&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps one of the most controversial choices of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/susd-effect/&#34;&gt;Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down Effect&lt;/a&gt; article was using the number of ratings&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; on BoardGameGeek (BGG) as proxy for &amp;ldquo;attention&amp;rdquo; to a game. So let&amp;rsquo;s double down on that! üòà&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If lots of ratings mean a lots of eyes on a game, we can ask questions like: What games get most of the attention? Do few games steal the spotlight? Or is the attention spread out evenly?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is pretty clear if we sort the games by their number of ratings and plot them from fewest to most:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/rating-inequality-gini-coefficient/num_ratings.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;The distribution of the number of ratings on BoardGameGeek, from fewest to most ratings per game&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that in this plot and everything that follows, I only include ranked games, i.e., games with at least 30 ratings. This is partially for convenience (we have excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/beefsack/bgg-ranking-historicals&#34;&gt;historical ranking data&lt;/a&gt; going back to 2016), but also because the BGG database is full of obscure games with very limited distribution and audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, what do we see in the plot? It&amp;rsquo;s clear that the vast majority of games have very few ratings, while a handful of games have a ton of ratings. This is a classic example of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail&#34;&gt;long-tailed distribution&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the data is concentrated in the &amp;ldquo;tail&amp;rdquo; of the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: there are three absolute classic games that have been competing for the distinction of most-rated game on BGG for years now. As of the time of writing, the current standings are:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;: 126,448 ratings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/822&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;: 125,850 ratings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/30549&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Pandemic&lt;/a&gt;: 124,584 ratings&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, obviously the attention of the board game world is concentrated on &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; few games. The 26,168 ranked games share a total of 24,353,222 ratings&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; between them. The top 1%, the 262 games with the most ratings, account for 35.5% of those ratings. Conversely, the bottom 23.2%, the 6,071 games with the fewest ratings, account for only 1% of the ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can we somehow quantify this inequality more precisely? Why yes, I&amp;rsquo;m glad you asked! üßê&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-gini-coefficient&#34;&gt;The Gini coefficient&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enter the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient&#34;&gt;Gini coefficient&lt;/a&gt;. This measure is commonly used to quantify income inequality, but it can be applied to any distribution of values. In our case, we can use it to measure the inequality in the distribution of ratings on BGG.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this, we dive deeper into the question: What share of all ratings do the top X% of games have? This is the cumulative distribution of ratings, and it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/rating-inequality-gini-coefficient/gini_coefficient.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;The share of the total ratings and the Gini coefficient of BoardGameGeek ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thin 45¬∞ line is the (hypothetical) perfectly equal distribution, where every game has exactly the same number of ratings; the thick curve is the actual cumulative distribution of ratings. The area between the two lines is (essentially&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) the Gini coefficient, which ‚Äì as you can see ‚Äì is &lt;strong&gt;0.836&lt;/strong&gt; in our case. A perfectly equal distribution of ratings (every game has the same number of ratings) would have a Gini coefficient of 0, while a perfectly unequal distribution (one game would have &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; the ratings, whilst all others have none) would have a Gini coefficient of 1. So 0.836 is really high, meaning a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unequal distribution of ratings. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t come as a surprise to anyone following the glut of new games coming out every year, with only a few of them getting the lion&amp;rsquo;s share of attention, whilst most of the rest languish in obscurity. Has this phenomenon changed over the years though? ü§î&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;historical-perspective&#34;&gt;Historical perspective&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer that question, we can look at how the Gini coefficient has changed over time. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it has evolved since late 2016:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/rating-inequality-gini-coefficient/gini_coefficient_over_time.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;The Gini coefficient of BoardGameGeek ratings over time&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, we started out this period with a little over 0.8 and have been steadily creeping up to over 0.835 today. This increase of inequality on a very high level is an interesting observation ‚Äì and somewhat worrying. For comparison: The most unequal country in the world is considered to be South Africa üáøüá¶, with a Gini coefficient of 0.63. The US üá∫üá∏ has a Gini coefficient of 0.40, Finland üá´üáÆ 0.27 and Slovakia üá∏üá∞ 0.23, the lowest value in the world.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Obviously, those values don&amp;rsquo;t compare directly, but they serve as a reminder of just how unequal the baseline in 2016 was, and the situation has intensified since then. So, why is that? One obvious factor is the number of new games being released each year. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at this plot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/rating-inequality-gini-coefficient/games_per_year.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;The number of games released each year between 1990 and 2022&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to unpack here. Start from the bars in the background: they count the number of games released each year from 1990 to 2022. Just look at the explosive growth from 2013 through 2019 in particular ‚Äì that&amp;rsquo;s probably the influence of crowdfunding. The abrupt drop in 2020 is, of course, due to COVID‚Äì19. Interestingly, the number of releases haven&amp;rsquo;t picked up since and 2019 remains the record year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The dots are the Gini coefficient just for that cohort, i.e., those dots measure how unequal the ratings are distributed among the games released in that year. The higher up a dot is, the more a year is dominated by a few games ‚Äì or just a single one. &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;, the most rated game on BGG (see above), single-handedly makes the 1995 cohort the most unequal year in the dataset. The sizes of the dots represent the most popular game of that year, so 1995, 2000 and 2008 get the biggest dots. Unsurprisingly, games with an uber-popular game (big dot) tend to have a higher Gini coefficient (high up on the y-axis).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;rsquo;s something else going on: whilst the number of releases have been skyrocketing since 2013, the Gini coefficients of the years since 2016 have been falling noticibly, indicating less concentration of the ratings on just a few games. Games released in 2022 form the first cohort with a Gini coefficient below 0.75 since the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how come that rating inequality is still rising? This might have to do with publishers&amp;rsquo; increased focus on evergreens ‚Äì flagship titles and lines that have proven to be consistently popular. Most publishers will rather release new expansions for and versions of a successful game than take a risk on a new one. So while new releases get slightly more evenly distributed attention, much of the overall attention (and marketing budget) is still drawn to select few games. Publishers and designers certainly complain that it&amp;rsquo;s increasingly harder for new games to get noticed and even get a second printrun, and the data seems to support those complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s worth pausing for a moment to consider if this inequality is actually bad ‚Äì or if it could even be a good thing. One should remember that the easiest way (arguably the only one) to achieve perfect equality is by assigning everyone the exact same value: zero. Put another way: while the &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; of attention captured by the top games of the hobby has increased, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean this attention has been taken away from the rest of the games.Ô∏è Overall, interest in modern games has been growing, so even the long tail of games should receive more attention overall when measured in absolute terms. A rising tide lifts all boats, at least that&amp;rsquo;s what those on the steering wheels tell those toiling in the engine rooms. üö¢&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might deduce that I don&amp;rsquo;t fully buy into this narrative. The continuing increase of the Gini coefficient, the focus on blockbuster title, the ongoing consolidation of the hobby board game publishers (although Asmodee has noticably slowed down after &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dicebreaker.com/companies/asmodee/news/asmodee-embracer-earnings-2023-saudi-arabia-deal&#34;&gt;their owners got too greedy&lt;/a&gt;) ‚Äì all of these are signs of a Marvelisation of the board game industry. Ô∏èHave we reached the end of this industry being run by boutique publishers? Will it all be nature kitsch, anthropomorphic animals or billion dollar licenses from here on out? I have no doubt that quirky and sometimes downright weird games will continue to be made, some of which will tackle difficult topics or push the boundaries of what a game can be. But I&amp;rsquo;m afraid those will be more and more pushed to the fringes of the hobby, while the mainstream will be dominated by the same old, same old.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS: I was inspired to write this article by Bluesky user &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsky.app/profile/slngshot-dvnngrod.bsky.social/post/3knwg4sgd2k2g&#34;&gt;Nick Sherefkin&lt;/a&gt;. If you have some insteresting questions about board games and data, why don&amp;rsquo;t you reach out to me on one of the channels linked below? Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll answer them in the next blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PPS: As always, the complete code for this analysis can be found from &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/blog/-/tree/master/experiments/gini&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Addendum 2024-04-25&lt;/em&gt;: Just a week after publishing this article, Asmodee&amp;rsquo;s (former) owners &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/04/22/asmodees-owner-loads-it-up-with-e900m-debt-amid-plan-to-spin-off-board-game-giant/&#34;&gt;Embracer Group announced&lt;/a&gt; that they are spinning off Asmodee into its own publically traded company, offloading Embracer&amp;rsquo;s debt of ‚Ç¨900m onto the board game giant. For years, Asmodee mostly cared about growth, but now that they&amp;rsquo;re burdened with 4 to 5 years worth of profits in debt, they will have to focus on profitability instead. Expect them to squeeze as much as possible out of their most valuable IPs, leaving even less room for new and innovative games. üí∏&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s worth emphasising that the SU&amp;amp;SD Effect article didn&amp;rsquo;t just use the number of ratings, but the number of collection items, which also include owned games, wishlists and more. This article strictly focuses on the number of ratings.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember that the number dummy ratings added to &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;calculate the geek score&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for the BGG rankings, is pegged to the total number of ratings. Since there&amp;rsquo;s one dummy rating for every 10,000 ratings, the current number of dummy ratings is somewhere around 2435. When we &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/&#34;&gt;last checked in&lt;/a&gt; around three years ago, that number was around 1729 dummies. Quite the growth indeed.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Gini coefficient is actually twice the area between the two lines. The line of equality cuts the unit square in half, so the area of perfect inequality would be 0.5. For the coefficient to be between 0 and 1, we double that area to get the final value.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:4&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality&#34;&gt;List of countries by income equality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</description>
