      <description>&lt;p&gt;Corey Thompson (of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@aboveboardTV&#34;&gt;Above Board TV&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://dicetowerdish.com/&#34;&gt;Dice Tower Dish&lt;/a&gt; fame) recently raised an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3336646/playtesting-327&#34;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamesinsider.com/&#34;&gt;Board Games Insider podcast&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In what year do you think the best titles (highest rated titles) were released?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He actually answered the question twice, first in episode &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/163710/board-games-insider-328-the-one-about-the-spiel-de&#34;&gt;#328&lt;/a&gt; based on an analysis he ran a couple of years ago and then again in &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/blogpost/164172/board-games-insider-330-the-one-about-the-biggest&#34;&gt;#330&lt;/a&gt; with more up-to-date data. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to spoil his answer here – the podcast in general is worth a listen – so go and find those episodes on your favourite podcast platform. But of course I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but answer the question myself, in the most needlessly thorough way possible. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;boring-technicalities&#34;&gt;Boring technicalities&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, we need to make sure we understand what the question is asking. I&amp;rsquo;d say there&amp;rsquo;s two general ways to interpret it: either average the ratings of the games released in a given year, or average all the ratings for all the games of that year. I think the difference between those approaches becomes much clearer with an example: Let&amp;rsquo;s pick the year 1995. There&amp;rsquo;s 224 ranked games from that year; all games (ranked and unranked) received a total of 276,158 ratings as of the time of writing. The former approach would be to average the individual ratings of those 224 games, whilst the latter would mean taking the average of those quarter of a million ratings. The reason why I picked 1995 as an example is of course because that year is dominated by &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;: This giant amongst hobby games alone accounts for almost half all the ratings from 1995. So when averaging games&amp;rsquo; ratings, &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt; would have as much weight as some forgotten title with 30 ratings (the minimum required to be ranked). On the other hand, if we take the average over all ratings, we&amp;rsquo;d have less an average rating of that year and more of an average for &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;. Neither approach would be right or wrong, they&amp;rsquo;re just different choices, so let&amp;rsquo;s try them both out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-from-rankings&#34;&gt;Data from rankings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;average-ratings&#34;&gt;Average ratings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the average of games actually presents two different options in its own right because BoardGameGeek (BGG) uses both plain averages for display purposes and Bayesian averages for &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the plain average:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_rankings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings from ranked games&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every dot is a year between 1970 (before then very few games have enough ratings) and 2023, with its height on the &lt;em&gt;y&lt;/em&gt;-axis indicating the average rating of all games released in that year (higher is better) and the size of the dot indicating the number of games. The acceleration in the past few years is striking, so looking at this plot the answer to Corey&amp;rsquo;s question would definitely have to be: &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt; (and counting).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;geek-scores&#34;&gt;Geek scores&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we might want to refrain from using those plain averages in this context for the same reason they&amp;rsquo;re not used for ranking: the averages for games with few ratings are just too swingy. So let&amp;rsquo;s look at the Bayesian averages (aka geek scores) instead:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/bayes_ratings_from_rankings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average geek score from ranked games&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a couple of interesting observations about this plot. First of, there&amp;rsquo;s a much more uniform linear trend going on, though there&amp;rsquo;s a notable drop in the last two years. That can easily be explained by the way the Bayesian averages are calculated: the dummies ratings that get added to the regular ones weigh much heavier on games with fewer ratings, which naturally is the case for newer games. So this plot tells us that &lt;strong&gt;2019&lt;/strong&gt; should be considered the best year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;linear-regression&#34;&gt;Linear regression&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Is it though? Or is it simply the most recent year with complete data? Shouldn&amp;rsquo;t the best year be the one that defeated the trend? To answer those questions, let&amp;rsquo;s first make the trend explicit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/bayes_ratings_from_rankings_reg.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average geek score from ranked games (including trend line)&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve added the &lt;em&gt;line of best fit&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., the one that follows the trend most closely, via standard linear regression. The shaded band indicates the 95% confidence interval, i.e., we can be 95% confident that the true trend line lies within that band.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very simply put, the trends tells us that the average game from 1970 has a geek score of around 5.516. This makes sense, since it is strongly pulled towards the value 5.5 of the dummy ratings added to calculate this Bayesian average. According to the trend, that geek score then increases year on year by about 0.004. This might not sound like much, but 53 years later, in 2023, the average game should have a geek score of 5.722. In increase of over 0.2 is huge for a score that is so strongly drawn to its mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, I was now talking of the hypothetical scores if they were indeed lining up perfectly on that trend line. The reality is slightly more messy, and we can now calculate the difference between the actual average values for a year and the trend line. Years that beat the expecation from the trend lie above that line, underperforming years under the line. So now we can find the year that is the best in relation to the trend of its time, which is … 🥁 … &lt;strong&gt;1977&lt;/strong&gt;. This might not be the most obvious year at first glance, but when looking more closely, it did bring forth iconic titles such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/1035&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Squad Leader&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/15&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/811&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Rummikub&lt;/a&gt;. In light of those games, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s a well earned title.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, one can also look at the underperforming years. Generally, it appears that the 70s are still held in high regards, whilst from the mid 80s to the mid 00s most years are underperforming, with the worst year being &lt;strong&gt;1996&lt;/strong&gt;. This makes 1995 with &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/13&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;CATAN&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/93&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;El Grande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/220&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;High Society&lt;/a&gt;, stand out even more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;data-from-ratings&#34;&gt;Data from ratings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve promised a different way to calculate the average ratings for each year, so now we look at all the individual ratings for all the games released in that year and average those. Here&amp;rsquo;s the result plot:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_ratings_scatter.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We see a similar increasing trend, but one that does continue to the present, so again, we&amp;rsquo;d have to say that the best year for games is &lt;strong&gt;2023&lt;/strong&gt;. Another interesting observation is that the slope is much steeper. Let&amp;rsquo;s make this concrete:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/highest-rated-year/avg_ratings_from_ratings_reg.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Yearly average ratings (including trend line)&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, the trend tells us that the average rating for 1970 is 5.926, but here the yearly increase is almost 0.03, an order of magnitude higher than when we looked at the geek scores, so we end up with a trend of 7.471 for 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, what years are the biggest winners and losers compared to the trend? The biggest overperformer, by quite a margin, is &lt;strong&gt;1980&lt;/strong&gt; according to this measure. It got classics such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/71&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Civilization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/41&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t Stop&lt;/a&gt; going for itself, which hit really hard in this metric since there&amp;rsquo;s so few ratings for those old games, as you can tell by those vanishingly small dots. Other strong positive outliers are 1982 (with &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/2511&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/2653&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Survive: Escape from Atlantis!&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the aforementioned 1995 and 1977.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most disappointing year in this category is &lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;/strong&gt;, which is curiously nested between the strong 2000 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/822&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/a&gt;) and 2002 (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/3076&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-for-significance&#34;&gt;Testing for significance&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I promised excrutiating details, didn&amp;rsquo;t I? So I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta answer one more question: Are those outliers significant, or are they just randomly spread around the trend line? Statistical testing is a vast field – so vast in fact that I always feel completely lost whenever I enter it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s not make things overly complicated. In their most basic form, most of those tests boil down to checking if values we&amp;rsquo;re looking at don&amp;rsquo;t stray too far from the mean. In our case, we look at the distances between actual values and the trend line and check how they are distributed. Those values that lie more than two standard deviations from the mean could be considered significant outliers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested in any of those statistical details, you can just call your favourite software package to calculate the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value, which – roughly speaking – tells you the probability that the effect you observed is due to random chance. The smaller the &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value, the more likely you&amp;rsquo;ve observed the actual effect you were interested in. Usually, an arbitrary threshold is chosen, often 5%. Observations with a &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-value below that threshold are considered significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our case, we have two years significantly outperforming the trend (1980 and 1982) and two significantly underperforming (1996 and 2001). So, I guess we can conclude by calling those years the confirmed best and worst years, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Except, it&amp;rsquo;s not that simple. (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t lying when I said I&amp;rsquo;d be going into unnecessary depths. 🤓) One possible interpretation of that 5% threshold is that you&amp;rsquo;ll get positive results just by random chance in 1 in 20 experiments. But when we just calculated &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values for 53 years, we effectively performed 53 experiments, so a couple of years sticking out randomly would actually be expected. Again, there&amp;rsquo;s a vast body of research to deal with those multiple tests. For good measure, I&amp;rsquo;ve checked the outcome for the procedures according to Bonferroni, Holm and Benjamini–Hochberg, but the result is the same for all of them: None of the years differ significantly from the trend. So I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve just wrote over 1500 words just to conclude that the best years in board gaming are yet to come. There&amp;rsquo;s some comfort in that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;golden-age-or-cult-of-the-new&#34;&gt;Golden age or cult of the new?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me finish with a more philosophical thought: We&amp;rsquo;ve collected a lot of evidence to confidently conclude that the average ratings have been increasing over the years and continue to do so, but what is the reason for this? Is it because we are, as many people claim, in a &amp;ldquo;golden age of board gaming&amp;rdquo;? Or is it a by-product of the &amp;ldquo;cult of the new&amp;rdquo; which willingly drops hundreds of dollars on games that don&amp;rsquo;t even exist yet, but which receive perfect ratings from their backers as if to reassure themselves that this was a sound investment?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s a definitive answer. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_inflation&#34;&gt;Grade inflation&lt;/a&gt; is a real thing, and if it affects professional teachers who (hopefully) put a lot of thought and attention into the way they rate students, I&amp;rsquo;d say it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume the same will be true for some random people judging games on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s also true that designer games are still a very young art form and their creators have made a tremendous amount of progress in their craft over the past decades. In that respect, it&amp;rsquo;s understandable that gamers want to express their appreciation for those advances. Let&amp;rsquo;s just hope we won&amp;rsquo;t run out of rating space before this century is over: At the current pace, every game will be a perfect 10 by the year 2110.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can find the full results from the ranking data &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_rankings.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the test results &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_rankings_stats.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, results from the rating data &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_ratings.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and corresponding test results &lt;a href=&#34;years_from_ratings_stats.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. As always, you can find the full analysis code and notebooks on &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/blog/-/tree/master/experiments/highest_rated_year&#34;&gt;GitLab&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-3.4.1.min.js&#34; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-widgets-3.4.1.min.js&#34; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-tables-3.4.1.min.js&#34; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;script type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; src=&#34;https://cdn.bokeh.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-api-3.4.1.min.js&#34; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BoardGameGeek (BGG) users can select their country of residence in their profile. The main purpose is to find other users in your region to play face to face or maybe trade games, but but over here at &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/&#34;&gt;Recommend.Games&lt;/a&gt; we obviously cannot help ourselves but to use this information for some interesting statistics. 🤓&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the usual disclaimer: We will have to rely on whatever information BGG provides. In particular, users can freely choose their country. As mentioned, this is meant to be the country of residence, but some users might rather choose their country of origin – or some outright nonsense. There are 19 BGG users who claim to be from 🇦🇶 Antarctica, for example. While I&amp;rsquo;m sure that the long polar nights on lonely research stations are perfect for playing board games, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if they have a lot of time to rate them on BGG. 🐧 (If they actually did, Antarctica would have 6,880 ratings per 100 thousand residents, which would make them the second biggest board game enthusiasts in the world – only behind the 🇻🇦 Vatican&amp;rsquo;s 6 reported users, resulting in almost 20,000 ratings per 100 thousand residents. 🙏)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On a more serious note, what exactly is a country is a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; political question and frequently highly controversial. I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick with the sovereign nations recognized by the United Nations and️ add users from subdivisions and autonomous regions to the parent country. BGG allows users to choose 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 England, 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Wales as their residence (not Northern Ireland though 🤔) – but for now, they&amp;rsquo;re all stuck together in a 🇬🇧 United Kingdom, if they like it or not. The borders in the map that follows shortly are even more contentious – I just had to stick with what the provider chose, and they emphasised the actual situation on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s look at some basic statistics. For this analysis, we used &lt;strong&gt;19.8 million ratings&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;347 thousand users&lt;/strong&gt; who selected one of the &lt;strong&gt;199 countries&lt;/strong&gt; as their residence. Close to &lt;strong&gt;88 thousand games&lt;/strong&gt; received at least one rating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how board game preferences differ around the globe, we want to calculate a ranking similar to the way BGG ranks games. Remember that BGG calculates their &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;geek score&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; based on a Bayesian average by adding a number of dummy ratings of 5.5 to each game. That &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/&#34;&gt;number of dummy ratings&lt;/a&gt; is determined by the total number of ratings divided by 10,000. We can apply exactly the same logic to calculate a ranking by country. Since we want to apply at least one dummy rating to each game, we only consider countries with at least 10,000 ratings in total – &lt;strong&gt;62 countries&lt;/strong&gt; meet this criterion. BGG ranks games with at least 30 ratings. If we applied the same rule to the country rankings, we would often have very short lists. So, I decided to include games with at least 3 times the number of dummy ratings in the country ranking, but never more than the BGG standard of 30.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enough of the boring technicalities, on to the fun part! 😎 Let&amp;rsquo;s first answer some basic questions: How many users from that country? How many ratings have the entered? How many ratings per capita? And maybe most interestingly: What is their favourite game?

The 62 country rankings have 26 different games in the top spot. These nine games are favourites in more than one country:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Game&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th&gt;Count&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/224517&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Brass: Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/161936&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/342942&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Ark Nova&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/233078&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Twilight Imperium: Fourth Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/167791&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/115746&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;War of the Ring: Second Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/187645&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Star Wars: Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/291457&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This looks almost identical to the BGG top 10 list – only &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/316554&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Dune: Imperium&lt;/a&gt; is missing, though it is 🇦🇷 Argentina&amp;rsquo;s favourite game. Overall, the country rankings are dominated by international hits, but there are a couple of local favourites with a strong tie to the country, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/188&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Go&lt;/a&gt; in 🇨🇳 China and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/368789&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;AFU: Armed Forces of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt; in 🇺🇦 Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Explore more details about the different countries in this interactive map:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;board_games_world_map.json&#34;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;script charset=&#34;utf-8&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34;&gt;&#xA;    var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();&#xA;    xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() {&#xA;      if (this.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; this.status == 200) {&#xA;        var item = JSON.parse(this.responseText);&#xA;        Bokeh.embed.embed_item(item, &#34;board_games_world_map.json&#34;);&#xA;      }&#xA;    };&#xA;    xmlhttp.open(&#34;GET&#34;, &#34;\/posts\/world-of-board-games\/board_games_world_map.json&#34;, true);&#xA;    xmlhttp.send();&#xA;  &lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As much fun as it is to browse the map, there&amp;rsquo;s also the blank spaces staring in our faces: Africa and South Asia, together representing over 40% of the world&amp;rsquo;s population, are almost completely missing from the international board gaming community. 🌍 Obviously, BGG being an American website only available in English means their data really only represents the Anglo-American gaming world, but still, it&amp;rsquo;s notable how Latin America and other parts of Asia are present much stronger on BGG. I think some focus and effort needs to go into closing those gaps on the world map. 🕊️&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly leave you without circling back to the question of what country is the most enthusiastic about board games. We&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned the statistical anomalities that are the 🇻🇦 Vatican and 🇦🇶 Antarctica, but if we only consider the 62 countries with their own rankings, which of those has the most ratings per capita? Here&amp;rsquo;s the top 5:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🇫🇮 Finland&lt;/strong&gt; (4953 per 100k residents)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🇮🇸 Iceland&lt;/strong&gt; (4932 per 100k residents)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🇨🇦 Canada&lt;/strong&gt; (3636 per 100k residents)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🇧🇪 Belgium&lt;/strong&gt; (3575 per 100k residents)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;🇸🇪 Sweden&lt;/strong&gt; (3337 per 100k residents)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those who were looking for the reason why my chosen home is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://yle.fi/a/74-20080027&#34;&gt;happiest country in the world&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve finally got the answers: we seem to play more board games than anyone else! (&lt;em&gt;Torille! 🇫🇮&lt;/em&gt;) In general, the Nordic countries sure hit the sweet spot here, with their highly educated populations (well versed in English) and strong emphasis on work–life balance. Also, you gotta have something to do during those long, dark winter nights. 🌌&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in the full country overview, you can find it &lt;a href=&#34;countries.csv&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have some pretty exciting news! 🤩 Since 2022-02-22, we&amp;rsquo;ve been using a new and improved ranking as the default sorting for our front page at &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/&#34;&gt;Recommend.Games&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;… What do you mean, you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed there&amp;rsquo;s a R.G ranking? You know, that thing that&amp;rsquo;s referenced in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/stats&#34;&gt;statistics&lt;/a&gt;? … You haven&amp;rsquo;t ever opened that view?!? 😱&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, let&amp;rsquo;s back up for a second. R.G&amp;rsquo;s primary purpose is a recommendation engine, that is, finding personalised game recommendations based on a user&amp;rsquo;s preferences (in this case as expressed through their &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/&#34;&gt;BoardGameGeek&lt;/a&gt; ratings). But we want to show some games to the users immediately when they load the start page, before entering their user name. Think of these games as recommendations for… anyone. What games would you recommend to a person if you didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about their taste? This is the implicit purpose of any &amp;ldquo;Top X entities&amp;rdquo; list. Since this is a recommendation site, we&amp;rsquo;d like to make this claim explicit, so the R.G ranking has always been those &amp;ldquo;recommendations for everyone&amp;rdquo;. What&amp;rsquo;s changed is the way those recommendations are calculated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recommendations are based on a technique known as collaborative filtering. Basically, the algorithm tries to learn the users&amp;rsquo; preferences based on their ratings, find users with similar tastes, and then recommend new games that user might like. R.G uses Apple&amp;rsquo;s implementation &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/turicreate&#34;&gt;Turi Create&lt;/a&gt; for its recommendations, which does a lot of magic 🪄 under the hood. One of those magic tricks is that it offers recommendations for users it doesn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about. The algorithm treats those users as new and offers some default recommendations that should be a good starting point for anybody, without any particular context. It&amp;rsquo;s exactly those recommendations that R.G has been using for years as our ranking and default sorting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, why change this and create a new ranking? There&amp;rsquo;s a number of problems with the old ranking. For one, it&amp;rsquo;s really swingy.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Seriously, just take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/history/fac&#34;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;history_full.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/recommend-games-ranking/history_crop_hu7f8881c2ae59177d1401aee3088d48ad_239973_0x300_resize_box_3.png&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Ancient history&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe more importantly, the exact algorithm to determine those recommendations for new users is extremely obscure. There&amp;rsquo;s been a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/recommend.games/board-game-recommender/-/issues/38&#34;&gt;long-standing ticket&lt;/a&gt; to find out what&amp;rsquo;s going on. The answer isn&amp;rsquo;t documented anywhere, but you can find it somewhere in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/turicreate/blob/30eced4508bf86c4c59a1fef96bd0b23363db283/src/toolkits/recsys/models/itemcf.cpp#L194&#34;&gt;these lines of code&lt;/a&gt;. Let me know if you can make sense of them, I&amp;rsquo;ve simply given up at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, I wanted to create a new ranking which I can at least explain. So here goes:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basic idea is to calculate the recommended games for all users, and then average those rankings. Those averages would become the Recommend.Games rankings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That sounds simple and intuitive, but, as the saying goes, the devil is in the details. For starters, there are over 100,000 games in the BoardGameGeek database, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/recommend_games/status/1498184269402980355&#34;&gt;over 400,000 users&lt;/a&gt; with at least one rated game. Calculating &lt;em&gt;all recommendations&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;all users&lt;/em&gt; would therefore mean over 40 billion user–game pairs. That&amp;rsquo;s a lot. 😅 But really, we don&amp;rsquo;t care if a game is the 1,000th, 10,000th or 100,000th highest rated game. Instead, we only recommend the top 100 games for each user. The highest game on that list receives 100 points, the next 99, and so on, until the 100th game receives a single point from that user. All other games will be awarded 0 points. The we can simply average those points across all users, and voilà, those scores become the R.G rankings. 🤩&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;… Except that&amp;rsquo;s still not the whole story. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t happy about the idea of a user who fifteen years ago left a single rating being equally important as someone who played and rated hundreds of board games over two decades of BGG history. That&amp;rsquo;s why I tried to model the &amp;ldquo;trust&amp;rdquo; we should put in different users&amp;rsquo; ratings. The idea here would be that we should trust a user&amp;rsquo;s rating more if two things are true:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They are a regular contributor to BGG, i.e., rate, log plays etc at least once a month over a long period of time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;They should rate games with a reasonable distribution, i.e., on a nice bell curve.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the first point we count each calendar month that the user was active on BGG (e.g., rated a game, logged a play, updated their collection). Then we take the logarithm (base 2) of that number – this means the score will rise quite rapidly in the first year of BGG activity, but then flatten out quite quickly. The goal is not to treat newcomers too harshly. Note that \(\log_2 1 = 0\), so new users with only one month of activity will start with zero trust and consequently not be considered in the rankings calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second point is a little trickier. Mathematically speaking, we want to assess how closely a user&amp;rsquo;s ratings follow a normal distribution. There are a couple of neat statistical tests that do that, the one that&amp;rsquo;s considered best is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test&#34;&gt;Shapiro–Wilk test&lt;/a&gt;. What we care about is a number between 0 and 1 that somehow measures how much a user&amp;rsquo;s rating distribution resembles a bell. Take, for instance, Tom Vasel&amp;rsquo;s ratings. He clearly users a nice spread for his ratings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/recommend-games-ranking/tomvasel_hu8122f04d0f9b00836ce5a39d456e5117_119633_0x300_resize_box_3.png&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Tom Vasel&amp;#39;s ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If on the other hand a user only ever rates games with a 10, never any other score, their factor would be 0, and again, they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take part in the R.G rankings calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, long story short, we have those two factors that are supposed to describe how much we can trust a user&amp;rsquo;s ratings. We can now multiply them with each other, and the higher the score, the higher will be our trust in their ratings, and consequently, the more weight their &amp;ldquo;vote&amp;rdquo; will have when calculating the R.G ranking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But before we go there, what users &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; we trust the most? Many of the highest scores actually belong to pretty random users, so I&amp;rsquo;m not comfortable exposing them here, but it&amp;rsquo;s interesting to compare some of the &amp;ldquo;celebrities&amp;rdquo; in the hobby (and yours truly):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;table&gt;&#xA;&lt;thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;User&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;Rank&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;th style=&#34;text-align:right&#34;&gt;Trust&lt;/th&gt;&#xA;&lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;/thead&gt;&#xA;&lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;tr&gt;&#xA;&lt;td style=&#34;text-align:left&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/user/w%20eric%20martin&#34;&gt;W Eric Martin&lt;/a&gt;

      <guid>https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the second part of a series explaining and analysing the BoardGameGeek rankings. Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;first part here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/&#34;&gt;Last time&lt;/a&gt; I left you with the nice result that &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/&#34;&gt;BoardGameGeek (BGG)&lt;/a&gt; calculates its ranking by taking users&amp;rsquo; ratings for a particular game and then add around &lt;strong&gt;1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5&lt;/strong&gt;. This so-called &lt;em&gt;geek score&lt;/em&gt; is used to sort the games from best (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;) to worst (&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/11901&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Tic-Tac-Toe&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One detail however we touched on in passing, but did not resolve, is how that number of dummy ratings develop over time. When the current calculation method was introduced, BGG founder &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/103639/new-game-ranking-system&#34;&gt;Scott Alden mentioned&lt;/a&gt; that this number would be pegged to the number of total ratings, but did not reveal any details. Challenge accepted!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to tackle this question, we need to compare that dummy number to the total number of ratings over time. Fortunately, thanks to the scraping done for &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/&#34;&gt;Recommend.Games&lt;/a&gt;, we have access to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2287371/boardgamegeek-games-and-ratings-datasets&#34;&gt;BGG games data&lt;/a&gt; over the past year or so. Using these snapshots, we observe how the number of games and ratings in the database has grown:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/games.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Number of games and ratings on BGG over time&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can now repeat the exact same calculation we did in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/#optimisation&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;: For each point in time, the algorithm searches for the number of dummy ratings that yields an estimated geek score closest to the actual score. Now, we have a bunch of data points that correlate the total number of ratings with the number of dummies used at that time. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/ratings.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Number of total ratings vs dummy ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We get a pretty nice straight line – the dashed line in the plot is fitted with linear regression, i.e., the straight line that most closely fits our data. Its formula is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\[ \textrm{number of dummies} \approx 0.0000997 \cdot \textrm{total number of ratings}. \]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means that for every rating entered into the BGG database, the number of dummy ratings is increased by 0.0000997. That number might look a bit opaque, but it&amp;rsquo;s actually very easy to interpret once you put the question to its head: How many ratings have to be entered for the number of dummies to increase by 1? You get the answer to that by taking the inverse of that factor, which happens to be about 10,032. This number is way to close to 10,000 to be a coincidence! We can conclude the exact formula for the number of dummy ratings:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\[ \textrm{number of dummies} = \frac{\textrm{total number of ratings}}{10\,000}. \]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of the time of writing, there are 17,287,904 ratings (give or take) in the BGG database, so there will be around 1729 dummy ratings of 5.5 added to the regular ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the number of BGG users &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2585742/happy-21st-birthday-geek&#34;&gt;rises steadily&lt;/a&gt;, this number of dummy ratings also keeps increasing. This is part of the reason why older games (particularly those with a newer edition) tend to drop in the rankings. When users stop adding new ratings, a game&amp;rsquo;s average rating more or less freezes. But because more and more dummy votes are added, the geek score decreases every time it gets recalculated, and so the older games drop in the rankings, while the latest hotness gets all the fresh votes, and shoots up to the top.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The circle of hype.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;BoardGameGeek calculates its ranking by adding around &lt;strong&gt;1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5&lt;/strong&gt; to the regular users&amp;rsquo; ratings. They called it their geek score, statisticians call it a Bayesian average. We use this knowledge to calculate some &lt;a href=&#34;#alternative-rankings&#34;&gt;alternative rankings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often describe &lt;a href=&#34;https://boardgamegeek.com/&#34;&gt;BoardGameGeek (BGG)&lt;/a&gt; as &amp;ldquo;the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/&#34;&gt;Internet Movie Database (IMDb)&lt;/a&gt; for games&amp;rdquo;. Much like its cinematic counterpart, the biggest board game database not only collects all sorts of information obsessively, but also allows users to rate games on a scale from 1 (&lt;em&gt;awful - defies game description&lt;/em&gt;) to 10 (&lt;em&gt;outstanding - will always enjoy playing&lt;/em&gt;). These ratings are then used to rank games, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt; occupying the top spot since December 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While BGG founder Scott Alden admitted in a recent interview on the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://fivegamesfordoomsday.com/2020/07/06/scott-alden/&#34;&gt;Five Games For Doomsday&lt;/a&gt; podcast that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t care all that much about the rankings, gamers around the world certainly do. They would discuss heatedly any movement in the rankings, question why games &lt;em&gt;X&lt;/em&gt; is up there while game &lt;em&gt;Y&lt;/em&gt; is missing, and generally criticise the selection for either having &lt;em&gt;too many&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;not enough&lt;/em&gt; recent releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reason enough for me to take a closer look at how the rankings work and some of the maths behind it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, we want to rank a game higher the better its score is. The first instinct would be to just sum up all the ratings users gave to that particular game, divide by the number of ratings, and rank games from highest to lowest. What I just described would be the &lt;em&gt;arithmetic mean&lt;/em&gt; (or just &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; if you feel less fancy) of the ratings, which is simple and intuitive, but suffers from a sever defect: a game with a single rating of 10 would always sit on top of the ranking, well ahead of much beloved games with thousands of votes that couldn&amp;rsquo;t possibly be all 10s.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The easiest fix is filtering out games with less than a certain number of ratings, say 100.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; That&amp;rsquo;s a decent enough approach, and yields the following top 5 games as of the time of writing:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/261393&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Dungeon Universalis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/219217&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Arena: The Contest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/291457&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/240271&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Core Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/209877&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;World At War 85: Storming the Gap&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notably, those are all very recent games with relatively few ratings.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Some might consider this a feature, not a bug, but when your intention is to create a list of the best board games, you probably do want to give a nod to proven classics, and not just the latest hotness. How to balance out these ends of the spectrum is in the end a choice you have to make, and no matter what it is, People on the Internet™ will not like it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The way both IMDb and BGG chose to tackle this issue is by essentially not trusting the ratings – at least not too much. The method boils down to assigning a new item in the database (be it movie or game) a predefined average by default, and only gradually trusting the ratings&amp;rsquo; average as thousands and thousands of users have cast their votes. More concretely the rankings are calculated by adding a number of dummy ratings with a chosen average value, say 5.5, to each game&amp;rsquo;s regular ratings. The result is that initially each game will have a score close to 5.5, but as more users rate the game, that score will move closer and closer to the conventional mean.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;BGG calls this their &lt;strong&gt;geek score&lt;/strong&gt;. Mathematically speaking, it is a &lt;em&gt;Bayesian average&lt;/em&gt;, and calculates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\[ \textrm{geek score} = \frac{\textrm{sum of ratings} + \textrm{number of dummies} \cdot \textrm{dummy value}}{\textrm{number of ratings} + \textrm{number of dummies}}, \]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;sum of ratings&lt;/code&gt; can be calculated either by, well, summing up all ratings or via &lt;code&gt;number of ratings&lt;/code&gt; ⋅ &lt;code&gt;average rating&lt;/code&gt;. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about the details though – &lt;em&gt;adding dummy ratings&lt;/em&gt; is really all you need to understand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, so that&amp;rsquo;s the concept, but crucially that&amp;rsquo;s not all the details. You still need to choose &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; dummy ratings you want to add and &lt;em&gt;what value&lt;/em&gt; they should take. Since People on the Internet™ who disagree with your ranking will try to manipulate it in whatever way they can, sites are usually very cagey about said details. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMDb#Rankings&#34;&gt;IMDb used to be more transparent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/103639/new-game-ranking-system&#34;&gt;as was BGG&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have to dig a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the easier of the two, the value of the dummy ratings. It is commonly chosen to represent some &lt;em&gt;prior mean&lt;/em&gt;, i.e., some decent estimate of the rating a new game in the database would have. A frequent choice would be to use the average rating across &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; games. It&amp;rsquo;s a fair assumption – without further information about a game, we don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s any better or worse than the average game. However, Scott Alden actually gave away the answer in that interview from the beginning: BGG chose the dummy value to be &lt;strong&gt;5.5&lt;/strong&gt;. Their rationale is that ratings range from 1 through 10, so 5.5 is the midpoint. Of course, people tend to rather play and rate much more the games they like, and so the average rating is around 7. Opting for the lower value here is part of the design of the ranking: it means a new game would enter the ranking rather at the end of the pack. On the other hand, using the mean as the dummy value means a new game is placed more or less in the middle. It is worth mentioning that IMDb does use the mean (or at least used to), but they only ever publish the top 250 movies, and don&amp;rsquo;t care about the crowd behind.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other value, the &lt;em&gt;number&lt;/em&gt; of dummy ratings, requires more work. Because some of the details and data are unknown, we cannot actually pin down the exact number that BGG is using. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;ll try three different approaches, and compare their results.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;formula&#34;&gt;Formula&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the surface, this should be super easy to solve: in the formula above, we know every single value but the number of dummy ratings. BGG publishes the number of ratings, their arithmetic mean, and the &amp;ldquo;geek score&amp;rdquo; or Bayesian average for every game, and we know that the dummy value is 5.5. With a little high school algebra we solve the formula for &lt;em&gt;number of dummies&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\[ \textrm{number of dummies} = \textrm{number of ratings} \cdot \frac{\textrm{average rating} - \textrm{geek score}}{\textrm{geek score} - \textrm{dummy value}} \]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we should be able to plug in those values for any given game, say &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/199478&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Flamme Rouge&lt;/a&gt;, and get the result. With 10,936 ratings that average 7.562, and a geek score of 7.266, this yield:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;\[ \textrm{number of dummies} = 10936 \cdot \frac{7.562 - 7.266}{7.266 - 5.5} \approx 1830. \]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, there&amp;rsquo;s about 1830 dummy ratings, end of story. Right? Unfortunately, not quite. When computing this formula for different games, the results vary &lt;em&gt;wildly&lt;/em&gt;, as you can see from this histogram over the results for the same calculation with other games:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/num_dummies_hist.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Histogram over the number of dummy ratings calculated by explicit formula&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And this plot is even cropped, the results vary from -1.4 million to +810 thousand, though some 90% lie within the above range, with a mean of around 1604 and a median of around 1590.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s going on, why are the results so inconsistent? The problem is the ranking&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;secret sauce&lt;/em&gt;. Both IMDb and BGG stress is that they only consider &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; voters for their rankings. That&amp;rsquo;s the most mysterious part of the system as it&amp;rsquo;s the easiest to manipulate, so we&amp;rsquo;ll just have to take their word for it. For this investigation it means that the average rating BGG publishes includes all the ratings, but the geek score might &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, clearly something is happening around the &lt;strong&gt;1600 ratings&lt;/strong&gt; mark, so we are at least getting closer to an answer. If exact calculations won&amp;rsquo;t work, maybe we can approximate the correct value instead?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;trial--error&#34;&gt;Trial &amp;amp; error&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a step back here. What we&amp;rsquo;re really trying to achieve here is not finding the exact formula for that mysterious &amp;ldquo;geek score&amp;rdquo;, but rather recreate the BGG ranking. That is, we want to find the values in the above formula, such that the resulting ranking matches BGG&amp;rsquo;s ranking as closely as possible. Luckily, statistics has all the tools we need. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman%27s_rank_correlation_coefficient&#34;&gt;Spearman correlation&lt;/a&gt; measures rank correlation – just what we need. This will be 1 if both rankings sort in exactly the same way, 0 if there&amp;rsquo;s no relation, and -1 if they sort exactly the opposite way. Again, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the details, just trust the maths.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we can do now is fairly simply and quickly compute the rankings for different number of dummy ratings, and pick the value with the highest Spearman correlation. Without further ado, here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;img&#xA;&#x9;src=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking/num_dummies_corr.svg&#34;&#xA;&#x9;alt=&#34;Spearman correlation for different number of dummy ratings&#34;&#xA;&#x9; /&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best correlation of around 0.996 is achieved with &lt;strong&gt;1488 dummy ratings&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it is worth noticing that the changes in the correlation are very, &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; small throughout the range we examined here (1000 to 2500), so let&amp;rsquo;s dig still a little deeper.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;optimisation&#34;&gt;Optimisation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we have here at hand is actually a classic optimisation task: a real valued function in one unknown (or two if we allow a variable dummy value as well) which we&amp;rsquo;d like to maximise. This is a well-studied field, with many fast and simple implementations that provide us the solution in no time. Unsuprisingly, we get the same result as above: the best possible correlation is 0.996 with around &lt;strong&gt;1488 dummy ratings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But since we made it this far, let&amp;rsquo;s take it one step further. So far, we tried to optimise the correlation in order to recreate BGG&amp;rsquo;s ranking. However, we can also try to recreate the actual &lt;em&gt;geek scores&lt;/em&gt;. That is, we can look for the number of dummy ratings that will yield the closest to the actual geek score with our calculations. What exactly we mean by &amp;ldquo;closest&amp;rdquo; is up to us to define. A common metric is the &lt;em&gt;mean squared error&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s not worth getting into the maths here either, but the general idea is that we want to punish outliers in our estimates more (qudratically so) the further away they lie from the actual datapoint. Long story short, this yields a minimum for around &lt;strong&gt;1636 dummy ratings&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take one last swing and see what happens if we don&amp;rsquo;t fix the dummy value at 5.5 but allow that to be variable as well. This is no problem for the optimisation algorithm and yields the following results:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the best correlation with &lt;strong&gt;1942 dummy ratings of 5.554&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the least squared error with &lt;strong&gt;1616 dummy ratings of 5.494&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Either of those improvements in the performance metrics are hardly noticable (in fact insible after rounding), but they do confirm nicely a dummy value of 5.5.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All things consider, we can be confident that BoardGameGeek calculates their rankings by adding around &lt;strong&gt;1500 to 1600 dummy ratings of 5.5&lt;/strong&gt; to the regular users&amp;rsquo; ratings. What exactly constitutes a regular user, and what ratings might be discarded due to shilling, remains a well guarded secret though. Note that the number of dummies is pegged to the overall number of ratings, so this is a moving target, and the calculations would change as time passes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now I must applaud anybody who actually made it all the way through this pretty dry and technical article. The real reason why I dwelled so much on the ratings, and how they are compressed into the BGG rankings, is to get a feeling of what&amp;rsquo;s going on behind the scenes, what the can express, and what they cannot or even &lt;em&gt;do not try to&lt;/em&gt; express. Another major take-away is that any of these decisions are choices that need to be made and that come with certain tradeoffs – like them or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, I have the feeling that both the Cult of the New™ and connoisseurs of classic games are equally unhappy about the BGG top 100, which one should probably consider a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;alternative-rankings&#34;&gt;Alternative rankings&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll send you off with some rankings that were obtained by making different choices for the two values that we discussed throughout this article: the number of dummy ratings and their value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-the-ratings-average-as-dummy-value&#34;&gt;Using the ratings average as dummy value&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned before that the average rating across all games is around 7 – a little&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref1:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; more precisely 7.08278. What if we chose that as the dummy rating, but left their number at 1600? The result should be a ranking that is a little friendlier to newer titles with fewer ratings as their score isn&amp;rsquo;t dragged all the way down to 5.5 in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/161936&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/233078&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Twilight Imperium (Fourth Edition)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/224517&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Brass: Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/55690&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Kingdom Death: Monster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/167791&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/291457&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven: Jaws of the Lion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/220308&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gaia Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/182028&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/187645&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Star Wars: Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sure enough, the brand new &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/291457&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Jaws of the Lion&lt;/a&gt; with less than 3000 ratings already shows up in the top 10. The other game that sticks out here is &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/55690&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Kingdom Death: Monster&lt;/a&gt;. This Kickstarter success story clearly attracted a lot of enthusiasts, but not necessarily the mass.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-the-top-250-number-of-ratings&#34;&gt;Using the top 250 number of ratings&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like IMDb publishes only their top 250 movies, we can consider the same and crank up the number of dummy ratings. A good number seems to be the 250th most rated game on BGG, which has been rated 12,014 times. Using BGG&amp;rsquo;s standard dummy value of 5.5, we obtain a ranking that is much more skewed towards proven classics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/167791&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/161936&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/169786&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Scythe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/12333&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Twilight Struggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/173346&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;7 Wonders Duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/3076&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/84876&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;The Castles of Burgundy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/31260&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Agricola&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/120677&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Terra Mystica&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The most recent release on this list is &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;, but we also meet again old BGG #1&amp;rsquo;s: &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/3076&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/31260&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Agricola&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;combining-both&#34;&gt;Combining both!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, let&amp;rsquo;s do what IMDb does (or used to do), and add to each game&amp;rsquo;s ratings 12,014 dummy ratings of 7.08278:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/161936&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/167791&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Terraforming Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/169786&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Scythe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/12333&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Twilight Struggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/224517&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Brass: Birmingham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/182028&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/187645&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Star Wars: Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/193738&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Great Western Trail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/173346&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;7 Wonders Duel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The effects of more, but higher dummy ratings seem to almost cancel each other out. Compared to BGG&amp;rsquo;s actual top 10, only &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/233078&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/220308&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gaia Project&lt;/a&gt; are missing, otherwise this ranking looks very familiar. Turns out, BGG did a pretty good job designing its ranking!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend-games.github.io/posts/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek-ranking-part-2/&#34;&gt;second part here&lt;/a&gt; where we nail down the number of dummy ratings to the dot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: You can find the notebook I used to do all the calculations &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/mshepherd/reverse-engineering-the-boardgamegeek-ranking&#34;&gt;on Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PPS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: Turns out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://godatadriven.com/blog/reverse-engineering-boardgamegeek/&#34;&gt;GoDataDriven did almost the same calculation&lt;/a&gt; three years ago – even with the same title! Back then, they estimated that BGG added 725 dummy ratings. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kaggle.com/jorgenieva/bayes-algorithm&#34;&gt;Jorge Nieva replicated their analysis&lt;/a&gt; with a more recent dataset, which thankfully yielded a very close match to our result: 1594 dummy ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout this article I only considered games with at least 100 ratings, mostly to ensure that the very long tail of games with few ratings won&amp;rsquo;t unduely skew the results. However, most of the calculations would only change in some negligible decimals when including all games.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref1:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:2&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/291457&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Jaws of the Lion&lt;/a&gt; is something of an exception here and will undoubtably shoot into the BGG top 10 very soon. In fact, it might be the only game with the potential to unseat &lt;a href=&#34;https://recommend.games/#/game/174430&#34; style=&#34;font-variant: small-caps;&#34;&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/a&gt; as the number 1.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li id=&#34;fn:3&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably even more common to use the &lt;em&gt;root&lt;/em&gt; mean squared error, but for boring mathematical reasons, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make a difference when it comes to optimisation. In fact, we could even drop the word &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; from our metric and still obtain the same optimal point, so let&amp;rsquo;s not dwell on this.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;</description>
