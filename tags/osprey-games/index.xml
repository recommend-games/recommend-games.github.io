      <description>High Society is a classic bidding game by classic designer Dr Reiner Knizia, most recently released by Osprey Games with a wonderfully classic look:&#xA;The general concept is quite simple: the players are members of said &amp;ldquo;high society&amp;rdquo; and are trying to outdo each other in showing off their wealth. The game is played over a series of rounds, and in each round, a card is revealed from a deck of 16 cards.</description>
