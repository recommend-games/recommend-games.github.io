      <description>This is the second part of a series explaining and analysing the BoardGameGeek rankings. Read the first part here.&#xA;Last time I left you with the nice result that BoardGameGeek (BGG) calculates its ranking by taking users&amp;rsquo; ratings for a particular game and then add around 1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5. This so-called geek score is used to sort the games from best (Gloomhaven) to worst (Tic-Tac-Toe).&#xA;One detail however we touched on in passing, but did not resolve, is how that number of dummy ratings develop over time.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: BoardGameGeek calculates its ranking by adding around 1500-1600 dummy ratings of 5.5 to the regular users&amp;rsquo; ratings. They called it their geek score, statisticians call it a Bayesian average. We use this knowledge to calculate some alternative rankings.&#xA;I often describe BoardGameGeek (BGG) as &amp;ldquo;the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) for games&amp;rdquo;. Much like its cinematic counterpart, the biggest board game database not only collects all sorts of information obsessively, but also allows users to rate games on a scale from 1 (awful - defies game description) to 10 (outstanding - will always enjoy playing).</description>
