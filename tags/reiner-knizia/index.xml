      <description>Spiel des Jahres 2024 nominations are just around the corner (watch this space for our annual predictions), but I wanted to take this opportunity for a look back over the history of the award. Specifically, I wanted to see which designers have been most successful at the Spiel des Jahres, Kennerspiel des Jahres and Kinderspiel des Jahres awards.&#xA;The first red meeples were given out in 1979. Since 1989, the jury also awarded the Kinderspiel des Jahres for children&amp;rsquo;s games, initially as an annual special award, and from 2001 as its own award with the blue meeple.</description>

      <description>High Society is a classic bidding game by classic designer Dr Reiner Knizia, most recently released by Osprey Games with a wonderfully classic look:&#xA;The general concept is quite simple: the players are members of said &amp;ldquo;high society&amp;rdquo; and are trying to outdo each other in showing off their wealth. The game is played over a series of rounds, and in each round, a card is revealed from a deck of 16 cards.</description>
