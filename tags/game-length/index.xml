      <description>High Society is a classic bidding game by classic designer Dr Reiner Knizia, most recently released by Osprey Games with a wonderfully classic look:&#xA;The general concept is quite simple: the players are members of said &amp;ldquo;high society&amp;rdquo; and are trying to outdo each other in showing off their wealth. The game is played over a series of rounds, and in each round, a card is revealed from a deck of 16 cards.</description>

      <description>Orchard is a beloved children&amp;rsquo;s game classic which is so old â€“ it&amp;rsquo;s as old as myself. ðŸ‘´ As one might expect from a children&amp;rsquo;s game, it&amp;rsquo;s really simple: roll a die, pick a fruit of the corresponding color, and put it in the basket. If you roll the raven, the raven moves one step closer to the orchard. If you manage to pick all the fruit before the raven reaches the orchard, you win together.</description>
